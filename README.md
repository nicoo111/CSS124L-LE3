# CSS124L-LE3
**You will create a simple text editor that can do the following:**

- Use a Window that serves as an entry point for the application. This window is used only to create a new file, load a file, or close the application.
- Bonus points if the Window above is capable of displaying recently edited files.
- Use a different Window to act as the Editor UI itself.
- Bonus points if the User is allowed to edit the style of the text (color, font size, font). Although you are not expected to allow Rich Text Editing or per-character customization.
- Prompt the user whether to save or discard their changes if they try to leave the application with modifications.
- Bonus points if the Application is capable of creating a backup of the User's current work and restore from that point on next launch. The user should be prompted with a Dialog whether they want to restore from the backup or not.
